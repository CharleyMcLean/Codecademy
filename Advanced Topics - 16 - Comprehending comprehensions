# Good! Now let's take another look at list comprehensions.

"""
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
"""

# Use a list comprehension to create a list, threes_and_fives, that consists only of the numbers between 1 and 15 (inclusive) that are 
# evenly divisible by 3 or 5.

# Remember, list comprehension syntax looks like this:

"""
list_name = [var for var in range]
"""

# You can include an optional if statement after the range. (You'll need such an if statement to check whether the numbers are evenly 
# divisible by 3 or 5.)
# Remember, modulo (%) is a good way to check if a number is evenly divisible by another.

threes_and_fives = [x for x in range(1,16) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0]
print threes_and_fives # prints [3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15]
