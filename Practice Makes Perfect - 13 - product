# Define a function called product that takes a list of integers as input and returns the product of all the elements in the list.
# For example:  product([4, 5, 5]) should return 100 (because 4 * 5 * 5 is 100)

# Don't worry about the list being empty
# Your function should return an integer

# You can use a loop to go through the elements of the list.
# It'll probably be useful to use the *= operator.
# Be careful not to start your total at 0, as this would make the overall result of the multiplication equal to 0! 
# (Anything multiplied by zero equals zero.)

def product(integer_list):
    total_product = 1 # set counter to 1, since it will be multiplied
    for integer in integer_list: # for each intege rin the list
        total_product *= integer # multiply it by the total_product
    return total_product

print product([4, 5, 5]) # returns 100 (4 * 5 * 5)
