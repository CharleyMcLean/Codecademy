# Define a function called reverse that takes a string text and returns that string in reverse.
# For example:  reverse("abcd") should return "dcba"
# You may not use reversed or [::-1] to help you with this
# You may get a string containing special characters (for example, !, @, or #)

# Consider how you would loop through text starting from the last character through the first character.

def reverse(text):
    new_string = [] # create an empty list
    index = len(text) 
    while index:
        index -= 1 # gets you to the index value of the last item in the string (on the first loop)
        new_string.append(text[index]) # append the value at that index to the list you created
    return ''.join(new_string) # return the joined string
        
print reverse("abcd") # prints dcba
