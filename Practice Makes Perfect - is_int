"""An integer is just a number without a decimal part (for instance, -17, 0, and 42 are all integers, but 98.6 is not).

For the purpose of this lesson, we'll also say that a number with a decimal part that is all 0s is also an integer, such as 7.0.

This means that, for this lesson, you can't just test the input to see if it's of type int.

If the difference between a number and that same number rounded down is greater than zero, what does that say about that particular number?"""

# define a function is_int that takes a number x as an input
# have it return True if the number is an integer (as defined above) and False otherwise

def is_int(x):
    if type(x) == int or x - int(x) == 0: # if x is an integer or if x has a '.0' after it (int(x) rounds down)
        return True # if x is 7.0, then x - int(x) would be 7.0 - 7 == 0
    else:
        return False

print is_int(4.7) # prints False
print is_int(5.0) # prints True
print is_int(9) # prints True
