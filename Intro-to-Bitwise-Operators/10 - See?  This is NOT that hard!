# The bitwise NOT operator (~) just flips all of the bits in a single number. What this actually means to the computer is actually 
# very complicated, so we're not going to get into it. Just know that mathematically, this is equivalent to adding one to the number 
# and then making it negative.

# And with that, you've seen all of the basic bitwise operators! We'll see what we can do with these in the next section.

# Instructions
# Click Save & Submit Code and observe what the console prints out.

print ~1 # prints -2 => -(1 + 1)
print ~2 # prints -3 => -(2 + 1)
print ~3 # prints -4 => -(3 + 1)
print ~42 # prints -43 => -(42 + 1)
print ~123 # prints -124 => -(123 + 1)
