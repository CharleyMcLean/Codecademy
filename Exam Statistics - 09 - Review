# You've done a great job completing this program.
# We've created quite a few meaningful functions. Namely, we've created helper functions to print a list of grades, compute the sum, average, variance, and standard deviation about a set of grades.
# Let's wrap up by printing out all of the statistics.
# Who needs to pay for grade calculation software when you can write your own? :)

# Print out the following:
# all of the grades
# sum of grades
# average grade
# variance
# standard deviation

# You need to use all of the helper functions that you've created and print out their results.

    total = 0
    for grade in grades: 
        total += grade
    return total
    
def grades_average(grades):
    sum_of_grades = grades_sum(grades)
    average = sum_of_grades / float(len(grades))
    return average

    average = grades_average(scores)
    variance = 0
    for score in scores:
        variance += (average - score) ** 2
    return (variance / len(scores))
