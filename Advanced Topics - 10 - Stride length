# A positive stride length traverses the list from left to right, and a negative one traverses the list from right to left.
# Further, a stride length of 1 traverses the list "by ones," a stride length of 2 traverses the list "by twos," and so on.

# Create a variable, backwards_by_tens, and set it equal to the result of going backwards through to_one_hundred by tens. Go ahead and 
# print backwards_by_tens to the console.

# Remember, the syntax is:

"""
new_list = old_list[begin:end:stride]
"""

to_one_hundred = range(101)
# Add your code below!

backwards_by_tens = to_one_hundred[::-10]
print backwards_by_tens # prints [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0]
