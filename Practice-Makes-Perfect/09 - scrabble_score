# Scrabble is a game where players get points by spelling words. Words are scored by adding together the point values of each individual 
# letter (we'll leave out the double and triple letter and word scores for now).

# Below is a dictionary containing all of the letters in the alphabet with their corresponding Scrabble point values.

# For example: the word "Helix" would score 15 points due to the sum of the letters: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8.

# Define a function scrabble_score that takes a string word as input and returns the equivalent scrabble score for that word.
# Assume your input is only one word containing no spaces or punctuation
# As mentioned, no need to worry about score multipliers!
# Your function should work even if the letters you get are uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.
# Assume that you're only given non-empty strings

# Have your function loop through the word that you are given as input and look up the score for each letter in the score dictionary. 
# Add the score for each letter into a total of some sort.
# Remember you can use the string.lower() method to make your string lower case!
