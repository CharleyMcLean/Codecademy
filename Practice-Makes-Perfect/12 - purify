# Define a function called purify that takes in a list of numbers, removes all odd numbers in the list, and returns the result.
# For example, purify ([1,2,3]) should return [2]
# Do not directly modify the list you are given as input; instead, return a new list with only the even numbers.

# Your code should share something in common with the is_even() function you defined earlier.

def purify(all_numbers):
    even_numbers = [] # empty list to add even numbers to
    for number in all_numbers: # for each number in the list
        if number % 2 == 0: # if the number modulo 2 is 0, that means it's an even number
            even_numbers.append(number) # we want to append every even number to our new list
    return even_numbers # return the new list after we've gone through every number

print purify([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # returns [2, 4, 6, 8]
