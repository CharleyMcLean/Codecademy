# The average test grade can be found by dividing the sum of the grades by the total number of grades.
# Luckily, we just created an awesome function, grades_sum() to compute the sum.

# Define a function grades_average(), below the grades_sum() function that does the following:
# Has one argument, grades, a list
# Calls grades_sum with grades
# Computes the average of the grades by dividing that sum by float(len(grades)).
# Returns the average.
# Call the newly created grades_average() function with the list of grades and print the result.

# Your grades_average() function should use the built-in Python len() function and your grades_sum() function to compute the average.
# Remember that integer division in Python will always result in an integer. We convert len(grades) is a float so that the average is a 
# float.

grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def grades_sum(scores):
    score_sum = 0
    for score in scores:
        score_sum += score
    return score_sum

def grades_average(grades):
    avg_grade = grades_sum(grades) / float(len(grades)) # be sure to use the float to get the exact average!
    return avg_grade

print grades_average(grades) # returns 80.423.....
