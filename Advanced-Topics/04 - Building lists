# Let's say you wanted to build a list of the numbers from 0 to 50 (inclusive). We could do this pretty easily:

# my_list = range(51)
# But what if we wanted to generate a list according to some logicâ€”for example, a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 50?

# Python's answer to this is the list comprehension. List comprehensions are a powerful way to generate lists using the for/in and if 
# keywords we've learned.

# Check out the list comprehension example in the editor. When you're pretty sure you know what it'll do, click Save & Submit Code to 
# see it in action.

evens_to_50 = [i for i in range(51) if i % 2 == 0]
print evens_to_50 # returns [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50]
