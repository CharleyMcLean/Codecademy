# You can think of a Python string as a list of characters.

# The string in the editor is garbled in two ways:
# First, our message is backwards;
# Second, the letter we want is every other letter.
# Use list slicing to extract the message and save it to a variable called message.

# It's important to remember that lists are mutable (changeable) in Python, but strings aren't; when you slice a string, you get back a 
# new string. The original string is unchanged unless you purposely "save over" it, like this:

"""
my_string = "Monty Python" # => Monty Python
my_string = my_string[:-7] # => Monty
