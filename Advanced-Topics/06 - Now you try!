# Great work! Now it's time for you to create a list comprehension all on your own.

"""
c = ['C' for x in range(5) if x < 3]
print c
"""

# The example above creates and prints out a list containing ['C', 'C', 'C'].

# Use a list comprehension to create a list, cubes_by_four.
# The comprehension should consist of the cubes of the numbers 1 through 10 only if the cube is evenly divisible by four.
# Finally, print that list to the console.
# Note that in this case, the cubed number should be evenly divisible by 4, not the original number.

cubes_by_four = [x ** 3 for x in range(1,11) if (x ** 3) % 4 == 0]

print cubes_by_four

# got this one on the first try!
