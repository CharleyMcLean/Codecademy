# Whereas items() returns an array of tuples with each tuple consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary:
# The keys() function returns an array of the dictionary's keys, and
# The values() function returns an array of the dictionary's values.
# Again, these functions will not return the keys or values from the dictionary in any specific order.
# You can think of a tuple as an immutable (that is, unchangeable) list (though this is an oversimplification); tuples are surrounded by ()s and can contain any data type.

# Remove your call to items() and replace it with a call to keys() and a call to values(), each on its own line. Make sure to print both!

# For instance, your call to my_dict.keys() might look like:  print my_dict.keys()

my_dict = {
    "Name": "Charley",
    "Age": 30,
    "Badass": True
}

print my_dict.keys() # returns ['Age', 'Badass', 'Name']
print my_dict.values() # returns [30, True, 'Charley']
