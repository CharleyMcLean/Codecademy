# The example above is just a reminder of the syntax.

# Create a list, squares, that consists of the squares of the numbers 1 to 10. A list comprehension could be useful here!
# Use filter() and a lambda expression to print out only the squares that are between 30 and 70 (inclusive).

# You'll want to filter for x >=30 and x <=70.
