# Finally, let's create an Equilateral class that inherits from our Triangle class. (An equilateral triangle is a triangle whose 
# angles are all 60˚, which also means that its three sides are equal in length.)

# Instructions
# Create a class named Equilateral that inherits from Triangle.
# Inside Equilateral, create a member variable named angle and set it equal to 60.
# Create an __init__() function with only the parameter self, and set self.angle1, self.angle2, and self.angle3 equal to self.angle (since an equilateral triangle's angles will always be 60˚).

# Hint
# Remember, inheritance looks like this:

"""
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # Your code here
"""

# where DerivedClass is the new class you're making, and BaseClass is the class it inherits from.

class Triangle(object):
    number_of_sides = 3
    def __init__(self, angle1, angle2, angle3):
        self.angle1 = angle1
        self.angle2 = angle2
        self.angle3 = angle3
    def check_angles(self):
        if self.angle1 + self.angle2 + self.angle3 == 180:
            return True
        else:
            return False

my_triangle = Triangle(45, 45, 90)

print my_triangle.number_of_sides # prints '3'
print my_triangle.check_angles() # prints 'True'

class Equilateral(Triangle):
    angle = 60
    def __init__(self):
        self.angle1 = self.angle
        self.angle2 = self.angle
        self.angle3 = self.angle
