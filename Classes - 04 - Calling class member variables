# Each class object we create has its own set of member variables. Since we've created an object my_car that is an instance of the 
# Car class, my_car should already have a member variable named condition. This attribute gets assigned a value as soon as my_car is 
# created.

# Instructions
# At the end of your code, use a print statement to display the condition of my_car.

# Hint
# Since the attribute condition belongs to the object my_car, you'll need to use dot notation to access the object's member variable: 
# my_car.condition.

class Car(object):
   condition = "new"

my_car = Car()

print my_car.condition # prints 'new'
