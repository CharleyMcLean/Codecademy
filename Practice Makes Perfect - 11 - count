# Define a function called count that has two arguments called sequence and item.
# Return the number of times the item occurs in the list. 
# For example: count([1,2,1,1], 1) should return 3 (because 1 appears 3 times in the list).

# There is a list method in Python that you can use for this, but you should do it the long way for practice.
# Your function should return an integer.
# The item you input may be an integer, string, float, or even another list!
# Be careful not to use list as a variable name in your codeâ€”it's a reserved word in Python!

# You can set a found variable inside count. You can then loop over your sequence and increment found every time you find an element 
# in the sequence that matches item.

def count(sequence, item):
    occurs = 0
    for x in sequence:
        if x == item:
            occurs += 1
    return occurs

print count([1,2,3,4,5,1,2,1],1)

#side note:  I solved this one on my first try!!!
