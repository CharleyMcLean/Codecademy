# Now that we have a function to print the grades, let's create another function to compute the sum of all of the test grades.
# This will be super-helpful when we need to compute the average score.
# I know what you're thinking, "let's just use the built-in sum() function!" The built-in function would work beautifully, but it would 
# be too easy.
# Computing the sum manually involves computing a rolling sum. As you loop through the list, add the current grade to a variable that 
# keeps track of the total, let's call that variable total.

#Define a function grades_sum() that does the following:  takes in a list of scores, scores; computes the sum of the scores; returns 
# the computed sum
# Call the newly created grades_sum() function with the list of grades and print the result.

# To compute a rolling sum, create a variable total that's initialized to zero. Then, as you loop through the list of grades, add the 
# current grade to total.
# Don't use sum as a variable name as it has a special meaning in Python!

grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def grades_sum(scores):
    score_sum = 0
    for score in scores:
        score_sum += score
    return score_sum

print grades_sum(grades)
